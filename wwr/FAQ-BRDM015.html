                <h1 class="question-1">Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h1>
                <h2 class="answer-1">Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however 
                    that children over the age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more 
                    if their children are all over 8). A common concern we get from parents is that their children will 
                    be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. 
                    The areas we are rafting through are some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you 
                    might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also 
                    comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all 
                    without telling stories...some of which are even true!
