                        Everything started in 2015, when we met in a camp, from our church. Moroni was 15, and Yohanna was 14. 
                        Despite him being more introverted, and her the opposite, more extroverted, they became best friends. 
                        Months went by and their friendship was growing, it was hard to find a day where they did not text each other. 
                        Until two years later, when both were really in love with each other. But like any other good drama, 
                        they did not start to date at that time. Yohanna was having a hard time showing her feelings to him and 
                        that she wanted something more, indeed, she was waiting for him to ask her out. Moroni, on the other hand, 
                        was showing clearly that he was into her, she knew it, but he lacked the confidence to ask her out! 
                        She was not being clear about her feelings (or he was sluggish, in her words), and he feared a "no" from her.

                        Some time has passed, and Moroni started to date another girl, and that was devastating for their friendship, 
                        they totally lost touch and became distant. 
                        Some months later, they met again, and even though their distant, they could not deny the feeling they had for 
                        each other. And that was the period they started to talk again and come closer one more time. She was very 
                        respectful with him in another relationship, and they were just treating each other as friends.
                        A few months later, Moroni went to serve as a missionary for the church in another state for two years. 
                        During all these years, they did not let one week pass by without talking, and in the meantime, he broke up 
                        with that other girl. Six months to come back home, they finally talked openly and shared their feeling of 
                        love for each other.

                        But if that was not good enough, during Moroni's mission, their parents moved to another state, as soon as 
                        he got home, he bought a plane ticket to see her, but the COVID pandemic came to Brazil and shuttered down 
                        the airports where he was living, and his trip was canceled by the airline company. They were devastated, 
                        because both knew that, in two months, it was Yohanna's turn to go on her mission and keep 18 months away from him. 
                        Even with those misfortunes, they finally officially started to date on March 20th, 2020, by distance.

                        For every week during her mission, they talked and talked, just waiting the day they would finally meet again. 
                        He never forgot to send a special letter to her every single month. While she was there, Moroni got a job in 
                        SÃ£o Paulo and moved away from his parent's home to live by his own and start saving money to propose her. 
                        Finally, in November 2021, she arrived, and they gladly met again after almost 4 years far from each other.

                        Few months later, on March 14th, 2022, they began to live their dream and he proposed her, 
                        and they became our bride and groom. Now, they are just waiting to start their live together as wife and husband.
