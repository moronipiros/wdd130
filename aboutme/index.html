    <p>Hi everyone! I'm from Brazil and very excited about this class.
        I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Business Management, but also doing the programming certificate.
        My goal is one day to have my own business, and my own website for it.
        So I combined my major and this certificate.</p>
    <p>I'm engaged to my best friend, I love to spend time with her doing anything,
        but especially we love to go out and visit new restaurants, that's our hobby!
        Two dreams we have are to visit and know as many countries possible,
        and one day serve as senior missionaries together.</p>
    <p>I hope we have a great semester together!</p>
